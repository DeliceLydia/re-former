## About Project

These projects was about building some forms, both using nearly-pure HTML and then graduating to using the helper methods that Rails provides.

## Built With

- Ruby v2.7.2
- Rails 6
- SQLite3

## Getting Started

* Clone this repo https://github.com/DeliceLydia/re-former
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/DeliceLydia/re-former.git
    ```
* Navigate to re-former folder
    ```
    cd re-former
    ```
* On the terminal, while in the 're-former' directory, run the following to install dependency:
    ```
    bundle install
    ```
* At this point, you still don't have the SQLite database. Run the following to get setup:
    ```
    rails db:migrate
    ```
* To interact with the project, run:
    ```
    rails server
    ```

    OR

    ```
    rails s
    ```
* Go to the browser and enter 
    ```http://localhost:3000``` to go to the homepage which display links to all users and for creating a new user
